Step 1: Generates summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.<br>

Step 2: Creates histograms to show the distribution of numerical features like Rent, Size, Floor, and Bathroom.<br>

Step 3: Draws boxplots to help visualize and detect outliers in numeric columns.<br>

Step 4: Uses a pairplot to visualize relationships between numerical features.<br>

Step 5: Displays a correlation heatmap to examine how strongly numerical features are related.<br>

Step 6: Uses interactive Plotly histograms to visualize rent distribution by furnishing status and tenant type.<br>

Step 7: Creates a scatter plot to show how rent varies with size, colored by number of bathrooms.<br>

Step 8: Compares rent distributions across furnishing types using KDE curves.<br>
