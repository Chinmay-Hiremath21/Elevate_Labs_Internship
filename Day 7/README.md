*What this code does (SVM Classification)*<br><br>
- Step 1: Load the cleaned dataset from cleaned_breast_cancer.csv<br>
- Step 2: Separate features and target labels<br>
- Step 3: Apply PCA to reduce data to 2D for easy visualization<br>
- Step 4: Split data into training and test sets<br>
- Step 5: Train an SVM with a linear kernel and evaluate performance<br>
- Step 6: Train another SVM using RBF kernel with GridSearchCV to tune C and gamma<br>
- Step 7: Visualize both decision boundaries using matplotlib in 2D<br>
- Step 8: Print accuracy and cross-validation scores for both models<br>
