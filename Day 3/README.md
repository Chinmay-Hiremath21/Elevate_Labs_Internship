Step 1: Loads the cleaned rent dataset from House_Rent_Dataset_Cleaned.csv.<br>

Step 2: Selects numerical features (Size, Bathroom, Floor) as predictors.<br>

Step 3: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20).<br>

Step 4: Trains a linear regression model using scikit-learn.<br>

Step 5: Predicts rent on the test set.<br>

Step 6: Evaluates the model using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.<br>

Step 7: Plots a scatter graph comparing actual vs predicted rent values.<br>
